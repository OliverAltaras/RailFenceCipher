# RailFenceCipher

I Rail Fence Cypher 00387943

Rail Fence Cypher 00387943 is an application that encrypts, decrypts and displays text files/URLs using the rail fence cipher.

II Launching

To launch it, you must use a command line. Once in the right directory, enter "java ie.gmit.dip.Runner".

III Options

The homescreen contains a menu with 4 options: Encrypt a file or URL; Decrypt a file or URL; Display the rail fence; Quit.
If choosing one of the first three options, you will be required to enter some extra information:
- You must let the program know whether you are choosing a file from your computer or from a URL;
- You must then enter the source file/URL (make sure the whole path/address is shown);
- Following that, enter the name and path of the file you want to write to;
- Enter the key;
- Enter the offset;
- A message will be displayed confirming that the encrypted, decrypted or displayed file has been generated.

If you enter an invalid input, don't worry: the application will let you know.
However, be mindful that the text is encrypted line by line.
So, make sure the key is smaller than the number of characters in most lines.

If you choose the option "Quit", the application will shut down immediately.
Please note that the program won't quit until you tell it to, i.e., enter "4" on the main menu.
